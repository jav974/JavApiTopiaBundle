## ApiTopia

This symfony bundle provides a set of annotations to define a full GraphQL schema, compliant with [Relay specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification/)

Annotations provided are:
- Query
- QueryCollection
- Mutation
- SubQuery
- SubQueryCollection
- Subscription

The naming convention and usage of this library is extremely similar to [ApiPlatform](https://api-platform.com/), so if you are familiar with it, you should feel right at home.
Key differences are:

- Multi schemas support, each with their own endpoint
- Full schema definition with PHP attributes, and reflection on DTOs
- Named queries, mutations and subscriptions are not suffixed with the class name (you can call them whatever you want)
- Fully configurable subquery and subquery collection
- Paginated collection resolvers are called with 'limit' and 'offset' arguments computed, even with cursor based pagination type
- Deferred subquery and subquery collection
- No ORM/DataSource integration, you have to provide your own data from the resolvers (but you can use anything you want inside them since they are services)
- No support for REST, only GraphQL
